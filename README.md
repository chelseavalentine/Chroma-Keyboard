# Chroma Keyboard

__Pearl Hacks '15 submission__

JavaScript piano player controlled through camera input based on chroma-key selections. We were inspired to explore new libraries, such as __Tracking.js__, __Beeplay.js__, __Transit__, __jQuery__, and __WebRTC__, while also having fun. We are most proud of the keyboard, which looks as realistic as we could make it, fantastic motion sensing, and our excellent troubleshooting and diligence.
